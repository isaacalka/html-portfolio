<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Isaac. I'm a curious explorer at heart, passionate about the stars, technology, and turning ideas into reality. Growing up, I was fascinated by the wonders of space—from the intricate rings of Saturn to the quirky sideways spin of Uranus and the groundbreaking feats of SpaceX, like catching a Super Heavy Booster mid-flight. That inspiration led me to create presentations on the Solar System and even dream up a rocket simulator game.

<p>In the tech world, I'm diving into coding, starting with HTML and JavaScript, and aiming to build educational apps and games. I've been self-teaching through online resources and am excited about opportunities like coding scholarships to take my skills further. Beyond screens, I love tinkering with crypto airdrops on platforms like Pump.fun and ZkSync, and I've explored ways to raise capital for budding business ideas
</p>
<p>My goal? To blend creativity, science, and tech to make a positive impact, maybe even launching my own ventures one day. Stick around as I share my journey, from stargazing tips to coding hacks. Let's connect!
